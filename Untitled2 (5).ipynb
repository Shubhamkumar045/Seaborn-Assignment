    "Que 1: Name any five plots that we can plot using the Seaborn library.\n",
    "Answer--Also, state the uses of each plot.\n",
    "Answer--Seaborn is a powerful Python visualization library based on Matplotlib. \n",
    "It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "Seaborn offers various types of plots to explore and visualize data effectively. \n",
    "Here are five common plots that can be created using Seaborn along with their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "E)Scatter Plot:\n",
    "Use: Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. \n",
    "They help in identifying patterns, clusters, or trends in the data.\n",
    "A)Histogram:\n",
    "Use: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable. \n",
    "They display the frequency or probability density of data within predefined bins or intervals.\n",
    "B)Bar Plot:\n",
    "Use: Bar plots are used to compare the values of categorical variables. \n",
    "They represent the frequency, count, or proportion of data points in different categories.\n",
    "C)Box Plot:\n",
    "Use: Box plots (box-and-whisker plots) provide a visual summary of the \n",
    "distribution of a continuous variable. They display the median, quartiles, \n",
    "and range of the data, as well as identify outliers.\n",
    "D)Heatmap:\n",
    "Use: Heatmaps are used to visualize the relationship between two categorical\n",
    "variables or between a categorical and a continuous variable. They display data in a grid where \n",
    "each cell is color-coded based on the value it represents, making it easier to identify patterns\n",
    "or correlations in large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que 2: Load the \"fmri\" dataset using the load_dataset function of seaborn. Plot a line plot using x =\n",
    "\"timepoint\" and y = \"signal\" for different events and regions.\n",
